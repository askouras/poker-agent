A 5-card stud (though this can be expanded to support other versions of poker.... probably) poker-playing AI agent that uses probability to determine its best move during each betting round.

Parts of the code are written with the intention to expand to more than one opponent for the agent to face, but this was dumbed down in certain parts just to get the ball rolling. "Easily" fixeable at a later point.
